#!/bin/bash

# Usage:

# 1. Prerequisites
#     Install the ip and ethtool tools on the system.
#     sudo apt install ethtool can-utils
#     Make sure the gs_usb driver is installed correctly.

# 2. Background
#  This script automatically manages, renames, and activates CAN (Controller Area Network) interfaces.
#  It checks the number of CAN modules currently present in the system, then renames and activates
#  CAN interfaces according to predefined USB ports.
#  This is useful for systems with multiple CAN modules, especially when different modules require specific names.

# 3. Main features
#  Check the CAN module count: ensure the detected CAN module count matches the configured count.
#  Get USB port information: use ethtool to get USB port information for each CAN module.
#  Validate USB ports: check whether each CAN module is connected to a predefined USB port.
#  Rename CAN interfaces: rename each CAN interface to the target name according to its predefined USB port.

# 4. Script configuration
#   Key configuration items include the expected CAN module count, default CAN interface name, and bitrate settings:
#   1. Expected CAN module count:
#     EXPECTED_CAN_COUNT=1
#     This value determines how many CAN modules should be detected in the system.
#   2. Default CAN interface name when using a single CAN module:
#     DEFAULT_CAN_NAME="${1:-can0}"
#     The default CAN interface name can be specified through a command-line argument. If omitted, it defaults to can0.
#   3. Default bitrate when using a single CAN module:
#     DEFAULT_BITRATE="${2:-500000}"
#     The bitrate for a single CAN module can be specified through a command-line argument. If omitted, it defaults to 500000.
#   4. Configuration for multiple CAN modules:
#     declare -A USB_PORTS
#     USB_PORTS["1-2:1.0"]="can_device_1:500000"
#     USB_PORTS["1-3:1.0"]="can_device_2:250000"
#     Each key is a USB port. Each value is an interface name and bitrate separated by a colon.

# 5. Usage steps
#  1. Edit the script:
#   1. Modify the predefined values:
#      - Predefined CAN module count: EXPECTED_CAN_COUNT=2. Set this to the number of CAN modules connected to the industrial PC.
#      - If there is only one CAN module, set the parameter above and skip the multi-module USB port configuration.
#      - Predefined USB ports and target interface names for multiple CAN modules:
#          First, plug one CAN module into the expected USB port. During initial setup, plug in only one CAN module at a time.
#          Then run sudo ethtool -i can0 | grep bus, and record the value after bus-info:.
#          Next, plug in another CAN module. Use a different USB port from the previous module, then repeat the previous step.
#          You can also use one CAN module to test different USB ports, because modules are identified by USB address.
#          After all modules have been assigned to their expected USB ports and all records are complete,
#          update the USB ports (bus-info) and target interface names according to the actual setup.
#          In can_device_1:500000, the first part is the configured CAN name and the second part is the configured bitrate.
#            declare -A USB_PORTS
#            USB_PORTS["1-2:1.0"]="can_device_1:500000"
#            USB_PORTS["1-3:1.0"]="can_device_2:250000"
#          Modify the quoted value in USB_PORTS["1-3:1.0"] to match the value recorded after bus-info:.
#   2. Grant execute permission:
#       Open a terminal, navigate to the script directory, and run the following command:
#       chmod +x can_config.sh
#   3. Run the script:
#     Run the script with sudo because it needs administrator privileges to modify network interfaces:
#       1. Single CAN module
#         1. Specify the default CAN interface name and bitrate through command-line arguments. Defaults are can0 and 500000:
#           sudo bash ./can_config.sh [CAN interface name] [bitrate]
#           For example, set the interface name to my_can_interface and the bitrate to 1000000:
#           sudo bash ./can_config.sh my_can_interface 1000000
#         2. Specify the CAN name by providing the USB hardware address:
#           sudo bash ./can_config.sh [CAN interface name] [bitrate] [USB hardware address]
#           For example, set the interface name to my_can_interface, the bitrate to 1000000, and the USB hardware address to 1-3:1.0:
#           sudo bash ./can_config.sh my_can_interface 1000000 1-3:1.0
#           This assigns the CAN device at USB address 1-3:1.0 to my_can_interface with a bitrate of 1000000.
#       2. Multiple CAN modules
#         For multiple CAN modules, set the USB_PORTS array in the script to specify each module's interface name and bitrate.
#         No extra parameters are required. Run the script directly:
#         sudo ./can_config.sh

# Notes

#     Permission requirements:
#         The script must run with sudo because renaming and configuring network interfaces requires administrator privileges.
#         Make sure you have sufficient permissions to run this script.

#     Script environment:
#         This script assumes a bash environment. Make sure your system uses bash instead of another shell such as sh.
#         Check the shebang line (#!/bin/bash) to confirm that bash is used.

#     USB port information:
#         Make sure the predefined USB port information (bus-info) matches the ethtool output on the actual system.
#         Use commands such as sudo ethtool -i can0 and sudo ethtool -i can1 to check each CAN interface's bus-info.

#     Interface conflicts:
#         Make sure target interface names such as can_device_1 and can_device_2 are unique and do not conflict with existing interface names.
#         If you need to change the USB port-to-interface mapping, update the USB_PORTS array according to the actual setup.
